    <div class="section-title"> Hello! I'm <strong>Marcus Christiansen</strong> </div>
    <p>
        I am a Software Engineer (with a focus and preference for backend) living in Boston. I love learning new languages
        and frameworks, building intuitive and scalable software, and <strong> getting things to work. </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        I am currently the Co-founder and Lead Developer @ <a href="https://www.considdr.com" target="_blank">Considdr</a>,
        a patented AI search platform that automatically crawls and extracts key insights from documents across the website,
        helping researches become and stay an expert on any market or trend.
    </p>

    <p>
        I graduated from <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/" target="_blank">Bowdoin College</a> where I majored in Computer Science.
        At Bowdoin, I was a team member of the <a href="https://research.bowdoin.edu/robocup/" target="_blank">Northern Bites</a>
        (where we coded robots to play soccer :soccer:), did CS research on campus my sophomore and
        <a href="https://research.bowdoin.edu/robocup/" target="_blank">junior</a> year summers, and was on the JV soccer team.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            I am passionate about learning and building cool things.
        </strong>
