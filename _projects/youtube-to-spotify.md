intro: "A Python script that converts your Youtube liked videos into a Spotify playlist. This script retrieves your liked videos from the Youtube API and uses the Spotify Web API to add corresponding songs to a new Spotify playlist. <b>I am currently working on turning this script into an AWS Lambda function that runs on a regular interval so that your Spotify playlist stays up to date as you continue to like new videos on Yutube.</b>"
